# Image-Classification
This Project is about how to classify the Image dataset containing three distinct electronic components i.e. Capacitors, Potentiometers, and Regulators with the help of python coding and using libraries such as Keras, Tensorflow, VGG16 using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network (a Supervised Machine Learning Method)).
